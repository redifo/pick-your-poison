## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

The w3 html and jigsaw css validators have been used to make sure the code does not contain any errors. The results shown below are the results of the final tests. During the development of the code this validator has been used multiple times but the results were not recorded before the testing file was created. There was only 2 warnings and they have been fixed before the testing file was created.
